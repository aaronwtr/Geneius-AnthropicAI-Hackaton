Geneius is a bioinformatical tool that streamlines scientific research by rapidly validating and generating a contextual understanding of gene-disease links based on simple user input prompts. The resulting contextual information is then employed to instruct Claude, our intelligent assistant, to execute one of two specific tasks, tailored to the user's preferences:

Task 1) Disease-Gene Link Validation: When presented with a hypothetical disease-gene link, Geneius searches through the scientific literature to find compelling evidence supporting this association. It then provides a molecular explanation, complete with a citation to the relevant research papers.

Task 2) Disease-Gene Link Hypothesis Generation: For users in need of insights about a specific disease, Geneius constructs a comprehensive disease context by extracting relevant information from the scientific literature. Claude searches and retrieves this literature, presenting users with a curated list of genes implicated in the disease based on scientific research. Furthermore, it elucidates the molecular mechanisms underpinning the involvement of these genes in the disease.

Geneius excels in presenting this valuable information in an easily digestible format, all while operating at remarkable speed. To put its efficiency into perspective, a highly productive human researcher, capable of reading at an average speed of 240 words per minute, would need a staggering 10 hours of uninterrupted reading to parse through 500 pieces of scientific literature. In contrast, Geneius accomplishes this task in around 5 minutes, thanks to its utilization of Claude's 100k token window when assembling our scientific context. This efficiency revolutionizes the way scientific hypotheses can be generated and validated.

Geneius was developed at the Anthropic AI Hackathon in London, on the fourth and the fifth of November 2023.
