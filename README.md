# Geneius: Disease-gene hypothesis and validation powered by Anthropic AI's Claude
Geneius is a bioinformatical tool that streamlines scientific research by rapidly validating and generating a contextual understanding of gene-disease links based on simple user input prompts. Geneius can currently execute one of two specific tasks:

Task 1) Disease-Gene Link Validation: When presented with a hypothetical disease-gene link, Geneius searches through the scientific literature to find compelling evidence supporting this association. It then provides a molecular explanation, complete with a citation to the relevant research papers.

Task 2) Disease-Gene Link Hypothesis Generation: For users in need of insights about a specific disease, Geneius constructs a comprehensive disease context by extracting relevant information from the scientific literature. Claude searches and retrieves this literature, presenting users with a curated list of genes implicated in the disease based on scientific research. Furthermore, it elucidates the molecular mechanisms underpinning the involvement of these genes in the disease.

Geneius was developed at the Anthropic AI Hackathon in London, on the fourth and the fifth of November 2023. More information here: [https://devpost.com/software/geneius](https://devpost.com/software/geneius)
